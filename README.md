My first project with a little JS, HTML and CSS .

*Rules:* 

*1.Use a number from 1 to 20 to guess the hidden number.*

*2.You have 20 score points and each time you don't guess the right number -you lose one point. At 0 you need to start all over by clicking "Again!".*

*3.Highscore is kept.*
